# thesis: Estimating the Number of Genes That Are Differentially Expressed in Both of Two Dependent Experiments
We are separately analyzing data from two experiments to produce a list of genes declared to be DE in each experiment. Each list is produced using a method that attempts to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in each experiment at some desired level α.
The number of genes common to both lists is used as an estimate of the number of genes DE in both experiments
We propose a method that uses the z- values from both experiments simultaneously to produce one estimate—which does not depend on FDR level α—for the number of genes that are DE in both experiments
We use two simulation studies (one involving independent, normally distributed data and one involving microarray data) to compare the performances of our proposed method, the commonly used method, and another method proposed in literature to test for consistency of replicate experiments
